## Problem Statement

Many people are interested in sustainable living, but there is no sustainability in their daily lives. Current platforms are either ineffective or fail to sustain long-term momentum. The challenge is to design a solution that tracks and encourages eco-friendly progress in a fun, interactive, and rewarding way.

## Why Is This Problem Important?

The environment is being damaged by global issues such as plastic waste, excessive energy consumption, and water usage. While the concept of sustainable living is gaining traction, many people struggle to incorporate it into their daily lives due to a lack of motivation or opportunities for social interaction and rewards. By making the process fun and engaging, we can help people build long-lasting sustainable habits.

## Existing Similar Solutions

**JouleBug** is a popular app that promotes sustainable living by helping users adopt eco-friendly habits. It offers features like challenges, tips, rewards, and tracking to encourage users to reduce their environmental impact.

### Strengths of JouleBug:
- User-friendly interface
- Variety of eco-friendly tasks and challenges
- Community features for social interaction and achievement sharing
- Rewards system to motivate users

### Weaknesses of JouleBug:
