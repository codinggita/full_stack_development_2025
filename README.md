### Problem statement
When we play games we use external app(ex.discord) for doing communication
between our friends in my website i implement a feature which works for doing
communication.And user can give ratings&reviews to games which are they played so
next user purchase that game with that review.

### Existing solutions  
For communication in games many players use different apps from different
platform in this case we can communicate but we have to install external app.


### Target audience
The user needs a platform which contains more feature in a single platform and
easy to use interface.In that time every platform gives only games at very high cost.
