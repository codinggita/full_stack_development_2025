## 1. Which problem is your project solving?
Planning travel itineraries, especially across multiple cities or countries, is time-consuming and complicated. Travelers often juggle between flight bookings, hotel reservations, sightseeing schedules, and local transportation.
Travelers want efficient, personalized, and hassle-free experiences. Current travel platforms focus on individual services (flights, hotels, etc.) but donâ€™t seamlessly integrate them into a personalized plan.

## 2. What are the existing similar solutions?
- **Google Travel**: Aggregates bookings and gives trip suggestions.
- **TripAdvisor**: Provides reviews and suggestions for attractions and accommodations.

## 3. How do you want to solve it?
Untrip will provide a seamless, all-in-one travel planning platform that helps users:

Discover destinations that match their preferences and interests.
Create tailored itineraries, from activities to accommodations, all in one place.
Access interactive tools that make trip planning easy and enjoyable, even for first-time travelers.

## 4. List the features you want to implement.
- book flights
- Hotel Booking
- Weather
- Maps
- Event 
- Budget Tracker
- AI Chat Assistant

- Social Features

## 5. Who is your target audience?
- **travelers**: They need to save time planning trips.
- **business travelers**: They want tailored recommendations based on their preferences.
- **vacationers**: They want all booking and planning in one place without switching between platforms.

It combines multiple services (flights, hotels, weather, and events) into one cohesive platform. Personalized itineraries reduce planning time and increase convenience.

## 6. What is the unique selling point (USP) of your solution?
Dynamic Personalization: Real-time updates and adjustments to itineraries based on user preferences, weather, or disruptions, differentiating it from static planning tools.
