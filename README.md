## Repository Overview

The **full_stack_development_2025** repository is designed to guide learners through various stages of full-stack web development. It covers the **front-end** with React and the **back-end** with Node.js, Express, and other technologies as the repository expands. This is a great resource for beginners and intermediate learners looking to build projects and improve their skills.

The primary goal is to provide a clear path for full-stack developers by covering:
- React for building interactive user interfaces
- Node.js and Express for creating back-end APIs
- Database integration with MongoDB (and more)
- Deployment using cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, etc.
