### Q1: What is the problem statement?  
There is no dedicated platform where users and workers can connect seamlessly for basic household tasks like plumbing, carpentry, or cleaning, making the process inefficient and time-consuming.  

---

### Q2: What are the existing solutions?  
Currently, there are apps and websites focused on specific services or tasks, but they often lack versatility and fail to provide a unified platform where users and workers can easily interact and collaborate.  

---

### Q3: What is the proposed solution?  
We aim to create a platform where users and workers can connect directly in one place. Users can post their requirements, such as plumbing or carpentry needs, and workers can respond to those requests. The platform will streamline communication and task completion efficiently.  

---

### Q4: What are the core features?  
- **User Profiles**: Users can post tasks and manage them from a single dashboard.  
- **Worker Profiles**: Workers can showcase their skills, experience, and availability.  
- **Task Management**: Users can post tasks with detailed descriptions, budgets, and deadlines.  
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Enable seamless interaction between users and workers.  
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Users can rate workers after task completion to ensure quality.  

---

### Q5: Who is the target audience?  
The platform is designed for homeowners, tenants, and individuals who need household tasks done efficiently. It also caters to skilled workers looking for job opportunities.  

---

### Q6: How will the platform be accessed?  
The platform will be accessible through a website where users can log in to post tasks or search for workers. Workers can also sign up, manage their profiles, and apply for jobs.  

---

### Q7: What technologies will be used?  
- **Frontend**: React for a responsive user interface.  
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side functionality.  
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user and worker data.  
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Socket.IO for live chat between users and workers.  

---

### Q8: What is the competitive advantage?  
Our platform combines a variety of services, making it a one-stop solution for household tasks. The real-time messaging feature and a transparent review system set it apart from competitors.  

---

### Q9: What are the risks?  
- **Scalability Issues**: Managing a large number of user and worker accounts could be challenging.  
  - **Solution**: Implement a scalable database structure and use cloud hosting services.  
- **User Trust**: New users may hesitate to trust workers.  
  - **Solution**: Verify worker profiles and provide a robust review and rating system.  

---

### Q10: What are the future plans?  
- Develop a mobile app for better accessibility.  
- Introduce subscription plans for workers to unlock premium features.  
- Expand services to include specialized tasks like event management and tech support.  
- Integrate AI-powered suggestions for matching users with the best workers based on requirements.
