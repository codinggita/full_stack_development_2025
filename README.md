 **project solving‬**
-
‬‭ My project solve the problem for customers use a online source of jewellery and view‬
‭ and explore more design.‬
-
‬‭ Many potential customers find it difficult to explore the full range of jewelry designs in‬
‭ physical stores. Showrooms can sometimes be overwhelming, and customers might‬
‭ miss out on discovering unique or new designs.‬
- Why is this problem important to address?‬
‭ Jewelry is often a significant purchase, and allowing customers to explore different‬
‭ designs, styles, and collections from the comfort of their homes is convenient. It also‬
‭ helps in building brand awareness and customer interest even before a physical‬
‭ purchase is made.‬
‭ 
‭
### the existing similar solutions
‭ Other jewelry websites and e-commerce platforms like‬‭ Tanishq, CaratLane, Bluestone,‬
‭ and‬‭ Zales‬‭ offer customers the ability to browse collections online.‬

‬‭ What are their strengths and weaknesses?‬
‭ Strengths:‬
‭ Vast catalogs of jewelry for easy browsing.‬
‭ Professional-quality images and detailed product descriptions.‬
‭ Weaknesses:‬
‭ Many websites are primarily e-commerce-focused, meaning they push customers to‬
‭ make immediate purchases rather than just explore.‬
‭ The browsing experience can be overwhelming or confusing with too many filters, or‬
‭ lacking aesthetic presentation of the designs.‬
‭
###  solve it

‬‭ - What approach or methodology will you use?‬
‭ Detailed, high-quality images of the jewelry.‬
‭ Easy-to-use navigation that allows customers to filter designs by categories (necklaces,‬
‭ rings, bracelets, etc.), metal type, price, and style.‬
‭
- ‭ Showroom-like experience‬‭ :‬‭ Recreate the atmosphere of a physical showroom with‬
‭ features like "collections" or curated groups based on themes (e.g., wedding collections,‬
‭ traditional designs).‬

###  List the features i want to implement.‬

‭ or customizations.‬

‭ Personalized Recommendations:‬‭ Based on browsing history,‬‭ show users designs that might‬
‭ fit their tastes.‬
