## 1. Which problem is your project solving?

Many coffee lovers lack a central platform where they can discover the several options of coffee, brewing techniques, and meet people with similar tastes. Secondly, small coffee vendors also lack visibility as well as an appropriate promotional platform to publicize their product effective.

Generally in most of the cases coffee lovers rely on resources like social media which can consume their time a lot. Also the independent coffee sellers  most of the time struggle to compete with large brands so we can provide them a platform where they can show their unique offerings. Kofi Hub aims to simplify the coffee journey for users while empowering small businesses to thrive in a competitive market.

## 2. What are the existing similar solutions?

Currently in market there are many big coffee brands for example starbucks and many more They provide information about their coffee options, brewing methods, and rewards programs.
