# Salon Website & Appointment

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**

In famous and popular salons, customers often face long waiting times, ranging from 1-2 hours to a maximum of 2-3 hours due to high demand and quality service. This time wastage is particularly impactful for busy professionals, including businessmen who travel to various cities or countries. They find it challenging to locate reliable salons that offer value for money and quality services. Our solution addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive platform that helps users discover salons based on location, view their prices, watch service videos, and explore the quality and authenticity of the products used.
